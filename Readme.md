This repository contains the code developed for the paper "Light-microscopy based dense connectomic reconstruction of mammalian brain tissue" 

# Structure
1) [Distortion analysis](./Distortion_analysis/)

    This directory contains the code and demo datasets to reproduce the disctortion analysis.

2) [Synapse detection and connectivity analysis](./Synapse_detection_and_Connectivity_analysis/)

    This directory contains the code and data to perform synapse detection and connectivity analysis. Parts of the demo datasets, required to test the code, are too large to be directly uploaded to the repository. They can be accessed and downloaded at the Institute of Science and Technology Austriaâ€™s data repository:
